# one-format
a unified format for textual data

This is intended to be a practical, lightweight format for texts with support for multiple addressing schemes and standoff annotationâ€”basically the simplest thing that can work.

It is based on prior work at the Greek Learner Texts Project, Perseus Scaife, and Digital Tolkien Project.

In heavy development and not ready for use yet.
